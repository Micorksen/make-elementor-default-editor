Make Elementor the default editor for pages, posts, and Elementor templates

== Description ==


This plugin simply changes the hyperlink of the title for Posts, Pages, and Elementor Templates to open them in Elementor instead of the default WordPress Editor. It replaces the original Open with Elementor link with a Default WordPress Editor link so you can still open it traditionally that way.

Clicking the title will take you to the Elementor editor directly.

Even non-Elementor-edited pages will become Elementor-edited pages now.

You can revert by clicking the "Back to WordPress Editor" button.

I welcome pull requests to make this plugin better!

== Installation ==

1. Upload `make-elementor-default-editor` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
